Observational data enables large-scale vaccine safety surveillance but requires careful evaluation of the potential sources of bias. One potential source of bias is the index date selection procedure for the unvaccinated cohort or unvaccinated comparison time (“anchoring”).This study evaluates the different index date selection procedures for 2 vaccinations: COVID-19 and influenza.
